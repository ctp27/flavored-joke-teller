# Flavored Joke Teller

Built an android app to provide jokes to the user. The application demonstrates the use of Java Libraries and Android Libraries. The Joke is retrieved from a local backend which provides jokes from a Java Library. The Joke is then passed to an Android Library which displays the joke.

The application also has two flavors, free and paid. The free version displays ads while the paid version does not. Unit tests have been designed to test the retrieval of the joke from the backend.
